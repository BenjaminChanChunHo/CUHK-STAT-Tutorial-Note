### Introduction
Hello, I am <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-chan-chun-ho/" target = "_blank">Benjamin Chan</a>, an M.Phil. in Statistics student at CUHK from Aug 2017 to Jul 2019. 
Moreover, I am a teaching assistant at Department of Statistics. You can find my tutorial notes here.

### STAT1011 Introduction to Statistics 
Students will learn the basic concepts of statistics, so that they will be equipped to understand statistical reports and recognize when the quantitative information presented is reliable. They will also learn about organizing and displaying graphical and numerical summaries of data, and drawing conclusions from them. The course uses computer interactive techniques, instead of tedious arithmetic calculations, to introduce simple but powerful statistical concepts. Topics include exploratory data analysis, statistical graphics, sampling variability, point and confidence interval estimation, hypothesis testing, as well as other selected topics.
#### 17-18 Term 1, 279 students    
Tutorial 4: Introduction of Discrete Probability Distributions <br />
Tutorial 5: Introduction of Continuous Probability Distributions (Normal Distribution only)

### STAT2006 Basic Concepts in Statistics and Probability II 
This course covers basic theories in estimation and testing. Topics include point estimation, interval estimation, unbiasedness, maximum likelihood estimation, hypothesis testing and likelihood ratio test.
#### 17-18 Term 2, 218 students
Tutorial 0: Review of Discrete and Continuous Probability Distributions <br />
Tutorial 5: Point Estimation (Optional - Frequentist vs Bayesian Statistician) <br />
Tutorial 6: Midterm Revision - Point Estimation Exercises <br />
Tutorial 7: Confidence Intervals for Mean <br />
Tutorial 8: Confidence Interval for Variance and Proportion

### RMSC4002 Data Analysis in Finance and Risk Management Science 
This course covers modern data analysis techniques that are commonly used in financial and risk management. Topics include applications of multivariate techniques such as principal component and canonical correlation to asset management, Value-at-Risks, GARCH model in estimating volatility, time series methods in term-structure analysis, and data mining methods such as logistic regression, k-mean clustering and classification tree, and neural network.
#### 18-19 Term 1 (Current), 47 students
