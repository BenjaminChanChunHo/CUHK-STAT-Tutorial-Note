### Self-introduction
Hello, I am <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-chan-chun-ho/" target = "_blank">Benjamin Chan</a>, pursuing M.Phil. in Statistics at CUHK from Aug 2017 to Jul 2019. Moreover, I am a teaching assistant at Department of Statistics. You can find my tutorial notes here.

Prior to that, I received my undergraduate degree in Statistics with First Class Honours and minor in Risk Management Science at CUHK.

### STAT1011 Introduction to Statistics 
Students will learn the basic concepts of statistics, so that they will be equipped to understand statistical reports and recognize when the quantitative information presented is reliable. They will also learn about organizing and displaying graphical and numerical summaries of data, and drawing conclusions from them. The course uses computer interactive techniques, instead of tedious arithmetic calculations, to introduce simple but powerful statistical concepts. Topics include exploratory data analysis, statistical graphics, sampling variability, point and confidence interval estimation, hypothesis testing, as well as other selected topics.

#### 17-18 Term 1, Course Instructor: Prof. Yuanyuan Lin, Student No: 279
Tutorial 4: [Introduction of Discrete Probability Distributions](https://github.com/BenjaminChanChunHo/CUHK-STAT-or-RMSC-Tutorial-Note/blob/master/STAT1011/STAT1011_Tutorial_4_with%20Solutions.pdf) <br />
Tutorial 5: [Introduction of Continuous Probability Distributions](https://github.com/BenjaminChanChunHo/CUHK-STAT-or-RMSC-Tutorial-Note/blob/master/STAT1011/STAT1011_Tutorial_5_with%20Solutions.pdf) (Normal Distribution only)

Optional: [Supplementary Proof of Theorems in Normal Distribution](https://github.com/BenjaminChanChunHo/CUHK-STAT-or-RMSC-Tutorial-Note/blob/master/STAT1011/STAT1011_Tutorial_5_Supplement.pdf)

### STAT2006 Basic Concepts in Statistics and Probability II 
This course covers basic theories in estimation and testing. Topics include point estimation, interval estimation, unbiasedness, maximum likelihood estimation, hypothesis testing and likelihood ratio test.

### RMSC4002 Data Analysis in Finance and Risk Management Science 
This course covers modern data analysis techniques that are commonly used in financial and risk management. Topics include applications of multivariate techniques such as principal component and canonical correlation to asset management, Value-at-Risks, GARCH model in estimating volatility, time series methods in term-structure analysis, and data mining methods such as logistic regression, k-mean clustering and classification tree, and neural network.

#### 18-19 Term 1, Course Instructor: Prof. Phillip Yam, Student No: 47
Many materials do credit to former instructor Prof. Pui Lam Leung. Related theories are covered in lectures while implementation in R is focused in tutorials. Stock price, zero-coupon bond, financial ratio and iris data are used for illustration.
